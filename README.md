# Tripadvisor Naive Bayes 

A Naive-Bayes-Classifier trained with subreviews from TripAdvisor to calculate a overall rating based on given subratings.

## Install

Before using the Application dependencies have to be installed.
These can be installed with the following command over pip.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The Server can be started running the `__init__.py` file.

```
$ python __init__.py
```

The web interface can be accessed over the ``index.html`` file in the ``web_interface`` folder.

## Force Training
